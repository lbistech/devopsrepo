WebServer: Apache2, Nginx
-	Installation
-	Configurations
-	How to make sure that my webserver Apache2 is running or not?
o	Systemctl status apache2
	Because I am using the AWS Cloud on which I have the ubuntu OS. I have a extra level of security which should be allowed us to visit our webpage
SSH: Secure Shell:
	By default port of SSH is 22
	Web traffic always run on 2 protocols:
o	HTTP -> port 80
o	HTTPS -> port 443


 
Apache2 – Nginx: By default port 80 listen
-	App1: 80
-	App2: 8080
-	App3: 8081
-	App4: 8090

	What is the difference b/w IP address and Port Number:
IP address: destination address
Port: address of internal service
Mac: Device address

Multi-site configurations in Apache2/Nginx
1-	Create .conf files in /etc/apache2/sites-available location
a.	For example abc.lbistech.com
b.	For example cde.lbistech.com
2-	Add below configurations in the .conf files
<VirtualHost *:80>
	ServerAdmin admin@lbistech.com
	DocumentRoot /var/www/html/abc
	ServerName abc.lbistech.com
	ServerAlias www.abc.lbistech.com

	<Directory /var/www/html/abc>
        	Options -Indexes +FollowSymLinks
        	AllowOverride All
    	</Directory>

	ErrorLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/error.log
	CustomLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/access.log combined
</VirtualHost>
	
3-	Run the command to enable the files
a.	A2ensite abc.lbistech.conf
b.	A2ensite cde.lbistech.conf
4-	Restart the apache2
