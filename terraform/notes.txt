There are few challenges to run this terraform module so follow the following steps: 
1- Comment out all of the following .tf files while creating the EKS cluster first time
    - aws-ebs-csi-driver-policy-role
    - aws-secrets-manager-policy-role
    - cluster-autoscaler-policy-role
    - fluent-bit-policy-role
    - loadbalancer-policy-role
    - Comment out the provider and data in the module -> eks -> main.tf file
    *** I will fix the above issue later in upcoming commits :) 

2- Make sure to give the IAM user access through AWS EKS console with admin access

3- Once the VPC and EKS cluster is created then we have to uncommend all of the above code and execute the terraform apply

4- Now you should be able access the cluster, nodes and all ad-ons are installed
